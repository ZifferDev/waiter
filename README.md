# Waiter

A *very* simple Minecraft server with a little parkour game to keep players entertained while waiting for their preview server on [Ziffer](https://ziffer.dev).

## Description

This project is based on [Valence](https://github.com/valence-rs/valence), a Rust library for building Minecraft servers.

The parkour game is based on the `parkour.rs` example from the Valence repository.
